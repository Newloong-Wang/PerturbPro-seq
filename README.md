# PerturbPro-seq

This repository contains the code used for data analysis and figure generation in the PerturbPro-seq manuscript.

## sgRNA Identity Analysis
- The `sgRNA_identity/K562/` directory contains scripts for determining sgRNA identity in K562 single cells.
- `sgRNA_umi_count.ipynb` is used to quantify sgRNA counts per cell.
- `verify_sgRNA_identity.R` assigns sgRNA identities to cells based on the quantified counts.

## Figure Generation
- `Figure1_defghijk.R`
- `SupplementaryFigure6_abcde.R`
- `SupplementaryFigure7_bcdeg.R`
- `SupplementaryFigure8_abcd.R`

These scripts reproduce the corresponding figures presented in the manuscript.
